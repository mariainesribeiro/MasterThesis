# Welcome to my MasterThesis repository!

Hi, my name is Maria Inês Ribeiro and I am all-in for open science. This repository contains the code developed to support my master thesis project:

- Ribeiro M. I. (2021). Comparison of Two 90Y-charged Glass Microspheres Liver
Radioembolization Dosimetry Methods: S-values and Monte Carlo - GATE. Dissertation submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Biomedical Engineering, NOVA University Lisbon, NOVA School of Science and Technology. Retrieved from: [coming soon]

Feel free to hit me up with any question! Here is my email: *mid.ribeiro@campus.fct.unl.pt*
