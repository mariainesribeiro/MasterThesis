# Quantification of tissue heterogeneity within the NLV and PTV

This folder contains the code developed to quantify tissue heterogeneity within
the NLV and PTV according to the obtained HU calibration.
First, each voxel in a CT image was calibrated to mass density,
reporting the statistical distribution of mass density within each VOI.
Second, each voxel in a CT image was assigned to a chemical composition bin,
reporting the percentage of voxels in bin within each VOI.
